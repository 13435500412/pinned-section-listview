Introduction
============

Easy to use ListView with pinned sections for Android. 
Watch [this video][1] to see `PinnedSectionListView` in action.

Usage
=====
 1. Replace standard `ListView` with `com.hb.views.PinnedSectionListView` in your layout.xml file.
 2. Extend your `ListAdapter` that it implements `PinnedSectionListAdapter` interface. Basically you need to 
    implement an additional `isItemViewTypePinned(int viewType)` method there. It must return `true` for all
    view types which have to be pinned.

 That's all. You are done! Working example can also be found under `examples` folder.
